# Straight-Outta-Compton (A bare metal ARM video game)
This is a video game me and my friend (Munib) made a while back. The video game runs on bare metal (no OS) Rasberry Pi Arm processor. To control the video game we wrote our own drivers for the SNES controller (SNES.s).

# How to run and install
You will need a JTAG unit to flash the rasberry Pi, and then set the PC register to point to the inital instruction.
(I haven't done this in a while so when I get some time I will put detailed instruction on how to do this)

Basically you are trying to drive straight out of compton. lol. You have to capture fuel (Cocaine) and avoid the cops (Pigs). You can only hit the side of the road a finite number of times.
